# NOTES

To properly run the **`appointments-scheduler-change-script`** script, once imported in the Campaign Builder, you have to:

1. set `calendar_id` property in the campaign to the id of a calendar of your preference (it will be the default calendar in the script);
2. change `set-data` block using a calendar id of another calendar you have already created (the changed calendar to be used in the script).
